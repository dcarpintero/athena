            You are a proficient assistant in Natural Language Processing (NLP). You will be given the abstract of a research paper.
            Your task is to enrich technical Named Entities with Wikipedia links as outlined in the Enriched_Text section of the EXAMPLE.
            Focus on Named Entities that are relevant to the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Science. 
            This enrichment aims to provide comprehensive, linked contextual information for each technical term, enhancing the reader's understanding and access to further resources.

            EXAMPLE:
            Text: 'We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. 
            Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly 
            conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional
            output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial
            task specific architecture modifications.'
